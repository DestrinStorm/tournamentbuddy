# tournamentbuddy
Tournament management software for a variety of tabletop gaming systems
Hosted on Google App Engine running in Python

TODO list:
fix 'paired down' flag for manual swaps
Manual repairing should check they aren't playing on a previous table
Round timings for non timed turns
Stop people being able to go back and re-pair
Safety check: when invalid results entered for cp/pcdest (null rather than 0) have error handling

Release notes:
Players can now be swapped into the bye seat
